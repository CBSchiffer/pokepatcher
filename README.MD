PokePatcher is an addon for the [Cobblemon](https://modrinth.com/mod/cobblemon) mod for Fabric [1.21.1]. 

It fixes a bug caused by Datapacks that prevents Pokemon with modified data from operating properly in certain scenarios by converting datapack files into Fabric sidemods.

I am not entirely sure why this fixes the issue, but my guess would be that it has to do with the mods loading at runtime alongisde Cobblemon, instead of at world start like Datapacks normally do.

Please do not reupload the converted mods unless you are the original creators, or are using them in a modpack with permission.
